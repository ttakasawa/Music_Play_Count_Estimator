\begin{abstract}
In the current state of the music industry, about 1\% of artists make up nearly 80\% of the total revenue in the market. The aim of our research is to create an assistant for recommendation systems that estimates the number of times a song would be played by a particular user, and therefore generate the most revenue for artists. By utilizing only audio data, we construct a system that is ignorant of an artist's popularity or other metadata such as genre. It provides a win-win-win situation for musicians, consumers, and record labels: Users will be able to discover new artists, up-and-coming artists could be recommended more often and allow them to gain a larger fanbase, and record labels will generate more revenue due to these increased plays.
