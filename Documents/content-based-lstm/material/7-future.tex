\section{FUTURE WORK}
The following suggestions for improvement of the developed system could prove to be fruitful paths to take.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Attempting to use a deeper or varied network:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Adding more LSTM Layers
            \item Adding more LSTM layers with the number of hidden neurons cascading
            \item Using more fully connected layers with a slower reduction to one output neuron
            \item Allowing dropout internally in the LSTM layers or in the dense layers
            \item Using an autoencoder to preprocess audio data before feeding into the LSTM network.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Increasing the amount of data for training the networks
    \item Using different loss functions than MSE
    \item Using different activation functions other than sigmoid in the neural network
    \item Use only a single time step with multiple networks and averaging the result of all networks
\end{itemize}
